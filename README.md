# SP500_10yrReturns_Regression
Personal project to practice running regressions in Python 
# About
I did this project so I could practice the regression techniques I have been learning in Python. As a beginner to Python and ML, I likely made some mistakes. I ran the analysis in April 2023.
# Data  
I combined and modified the csv file in excel.  
Data sources:

  * Calculated 10-year compounding total returns by multiplying returns of current and next 9 years
